# Wilderness Now

The site is served using GitHub pages: http://aliblackwell.github.io/wilderness-now/

The 'develop' branch is where the majority of development work takes place.

The 'master' branch is our staging branch, and should be production-ready.

The 'gh-pages' branch is our live, production branch. Anything that gets committed to 'gh-pages' will go live.

Images and fonts are served from Amazon Cloudflare. Instructions for uploading images to follow.

### Making changes

Check out this guide to understand the Github Flow:

https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

To make changes, create a new branch (based off either gh-pages or master) using the dropdown menu on the repository homepage. Call it 'your-name/what-you-are-updating'.

Make your changes and commit them into your branch.

Once you are finished, create a pull request into the master branch. All Pull Requests need to be reviewed! Once your branch has been merged into the master branch, it is ready to go live.

Merging master into the gh-pages branch will publish your changes on the main site, automatically.
